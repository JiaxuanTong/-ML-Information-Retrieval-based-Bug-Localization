Abstract:

Bugs are inevitable in software development, and bug fixing is an important topic that people take seriously. Which source file should developers fix when they receive a bug report? Which source file could be relevant? In this report, the information retrieval-based bug localization based on bug reports will be introduced and studied. The idea and operation are generally followed by the article: Where should the bugs be fixed? More accurate information retrieval-based bug localization based on bug reports. The implementation and experiment of bug localization include applying different IRFL (Information Retrieval-based Fault Localization) approaches, in other words, simplified versions of BugLocation, and evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed bug localization method by using metrics such as MAP(Mean Average Precision). Furthermore, many information retrieval models used in bug localization methods such as TF.IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and LSA(Latent Semantic Analysis) will be researched, implemented and compared.
